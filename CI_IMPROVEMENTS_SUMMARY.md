# CI Improvements Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed CI Pipeline Issues**
- Updated CI workflow to use `pnpm` instead of `npm` (matching project package manager)
- Replaced failing FFmpeg GitHub Action with direct `apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Added timeouts to prevent hanging tests
- Added Gemini API key to GitHub secrets for vision validation tests

### 2. **Test Organization**
- Moved Bun-specific test files that were incorrectly in the SDK package
- Updated vitest config to exclude Bun test files
- Created minimal CI test suite for faster feedback

### 3. **Cassette & Cost Control**
- Added `cassette.config.json` for centralized cassette configuration
- Implemented vision cost control to limit API usage
- Ensured cassettes are always stored for online usage
- Added `.vision-usage.json` to gitignore

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Created minimal test suite (`ci-minimal.test.ts`) for push events
- Comprehensive tests only run on PRs
- Reduced test concurrency to 2 for CI stability
- Added test setup to ensure required directories exist

### 5. **Configuration Files Added**
- `apps/bun-runtime/cassette.config.json` - Cassette management configuration
- `apps/bun-runtime/bunfig.toml` - Bun test runner configuration
- `apps/bun-runtime/test-setup.ts` - Test environment setup
- `apps/bun-runtime/src/vision-cost-control.ts` - Vision API usage management

## CI Performance

**Before**: Tests were hanging indefinitely
**After**: CI completes in ~1 minute (49s for Bun tests, 19s for unit tests)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CI performance over time
2. Gradually add more tests to the minimal suite as needed
3. Consider caching dependencies between runs
4. Set up branch protection rules to require CI passing

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
cd apps/bun-runtime
bun test

# Run minimal CI tests
bun test ci-minimal.test.ts

# Run specific test file
bun test image-caption-examples.test.ts
```

## Environment Variables

- `CASSETTE_MODE`: Set to `record`, `replay`, or `auto` (default: `auto`)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for vision validation tests
- `CI`: Automatically set by GitHub Actions

The CI is now stable and provides fast feedback for development!
